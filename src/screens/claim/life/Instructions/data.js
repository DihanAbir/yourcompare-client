    question: `What is the period of the policy?`,
    answer: `
    A motor policy is usually valid for a period of one year and has to be renewed before the due date.
     Pay the premium on time. No Insurer offers a grace period for paying the premium.
    In case of lapse of policy by even one day, the vehicle has to be inspected. 
    Moreover, if a comprehensive policy is allowed to lapse for more than 90 days, 
    the accrued benefit of NCB (No Claim Bonus) is also lost.

    question: `What is No Claim Bonus?`,
    answer: `No Claim Bonus (NCB) is the benefit accrued to an insured for not making any claims during the previous policy period. As per current norms in India, it ranges from 20% on the Own Damage premium (and not on Liability premium) and progressively increases to a maximum of 50%. If, however, a claim is lodged, the No Claim Bonus is lost in the subsequent policy period. NCB is given to the insured and not to the insured vehicle. Hence, on transfer of the vehicle, the insurance policy can be transferred to new owner but not the NCB. The new owner has to pay the difference on account of NCB for the balance policy period.The original owner can, however, use the NCB on a new vehicle purchased by him.`

    question: `Will my no claim bonus get migrated if I want to change my insurance company?`,
    answer: `
    Yes, you can avail of the NCB facility if you change the insurer on renewal. You would have to produce proof of the NCB earned by way of renewal notice from the current insurer. Alternately, you can produce your original, expiring policy along with a certification that you have lodged no claims on the expiring policy. For this the proof can be in the form of a renewal notice or a letter confirming the NCB entitlement from the previous insurer.
